Integrate reliable evidence from varied sources
I chose the great technology giant company, Microsoft for my technology of choice due
to its popularity in the technology industry to write about in this project. Microsoft is being
named a technology giant that helps a lot of businesses, beginners, and some other large
enterprises to deploy their projects. I picked this technology because it’s the same one that I
wrote about in my first week's activity for this class. I’ve been using computers for the past
twenty years in counting which I went to school for, I can really say that I still don’t know a lot
about them. I can take them apart and describe mainly very single components and some of the
processes from the time your press the power button. There’s much more than gathering the parts
together to connect them to the motherboard. A piece of Hardware is useless without software
and the same for software too. They need a place to live, like parasites that require a living host
to stay alive. Throughout this project I will be using this site: https://www.history.com/this-dayin-
history/microsoft-founded to work on the project to provide supporting details, and
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/functional-lens-promises-to-improve-thequality-
of-life-for-diabetics-and-others/ for some more other supporting details as well.
Describe a social, cultural, or global event

The great technology giant company, Microsoft was founded on April 4th, 1975 two best
friends name Bill Gates and Paul Allen. The two met while in high Scholl and decided that they
will change the world. When Gates and Allen started the company Microsoft, it was originally
called Micro-Soft since they were making microprocessors and software for an Altair 8800
personal computer at that time. Allen then left his job as a programmer in Boston and Gates
dropped out of Harvard University to focus more on their company. After publishing their Alter
8800, by the end of 1978, the company’s sales went up to more than $1 million and they had to
move the business headquarters to Bellevue, Washington. The organization then went for its
licensing in MS-DOS to IBM for its first personal computer in 1981. Allen had to leave the
company after finding out that he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1983, but he got
treated for the disease and ventured into other businesses.
Describe the technology
In the year of 1985, the company went to release a new operating system, Windows, with
a graphical user interface (GUI) with a drop-down menu, scroll bars, and other features included.
The company moved its headquarters to Redmond, Washington in the following year and also
went public at $21 per share. The company revenue went up to $61 million. “In 1995, amidst
skyrocketing purchases of personal computers for home and office use, Windows 95 made its
debut. It included such innovations as the Start menu (TV commercials for Windows 95 featured
the Rolling Stones singing “Start Me Up”) and 7 million copies of the new product were sold in
the first five weeks. During the second half of the 1990s, Internet usage took off, and Microsoft
introduced its web browser, Internet Explorer, in 1995.”
Assess the societal or cultural influences

This company has saved a lot of lives since it started. The owners have opened so many
doors with opportunities for a lot of us, myself included. I remember when I had my first
computer back in 1999, it was the greatest gift I ever had. I had an unmatching keyboard and
mouse with a cream color. I treated it like it was gold that it was. Even though it wasn’t brand
new, it was my computer and that’s when I started to type on a keyboard. I was eager to learn
much more about computers and this is why I went to school for computers after high school,
well after I attempted many other fields. This piece of technology will be with us for years to
come. And all thanks to these two guys and so many others like the late Steve Job. We can save
this topic for another project.
Natural and applied sciences lens
The natural and applied sciences lens that I know a lot of people can relate to is type 1
diabetes. This is a really big issue in the American Culture and it’s not only affecting adults now,
younger adults are being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. NUI technology has the capability to
provide benefits to users that are with type 1 diabetes and a better way to monitor their blood
blue. When I used to work at the hospital and when I was doing labs as per my class curriculum,
this is something I check on the patients throughout the time I was there. The small needles go
through the patient's fingers, they have to rotate fingers at a time. The sticky sounds and pray that
you’ll enough blood so that you won’t stick them again. Each time I will walk into the room,
some of my patients’ favorite word was, “Again” with sad looks on their faces. With the help of
NUI technology by Microsoft, patients won’t need to go through this as much “I’m used to
testing myself six to eight times per day. I’ve been doing it for 30 years,” McFeely says. “But
boy, when I think about my children… I mean, you have a spring-loaded needle that’s coming

into your finger, and it hurts them. I can see their faces [when they test], and I can see them
cringe.”
Apply the social science lens to your technology
Science and technology have become increasingly sophisticated which we as human
being faced today. In today of social science in technology, we are in need of people with some
understanding of social, political, economic, and legal issues as well as good understanding of
technology. As stated by (Kathleen Vogel, 2014), we need to understand the tremendous
technical problems and the controversies that we face.
