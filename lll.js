hi

Technology plays a huge role in my like. I feel that a big event in technology that
I have experienced and still do is the ability to have internet to attend school
and complete my projects for my job. Where I live and grew up, there has been
no type of innovation to bring quality internet to my town. I’m 28 and this has
been going on for year. The only thing available to my town in satellite internet
which is like the bottom of the barrel. I found out that companies like Charter
that offered cable internet had no internet in coming to my area. So after some
heavy research, I started to find all types of alternatives but that weren’t exactly
the right fit for the uses I needed it for. Luck would have it that out of the blue
they placed a cell phone tower for ATT near my house and didn’t understand
why in such a rural area. I immediately started researching again about the
same internet source my phone uses which is LTE. Its fast, doesn’t go out in the
rain and I can download and play games and shows without trouble. I
unfortunately didn’t know that it could be used for a home internet source that
was different in a sense from a mobile hotspot. After finding this out, I found a
company, outside of ATT, that offered the same deal as if it were cable internet
and have been in business ever since. The experience really opened my eyes on
the beauty of technology. It taught me to never be stuck on normal solutions
but to always go outside the box with other possibilities. Without that tower
being near me, I don’t think I would have made in back into school.
I would say that a current technological issue that I find interesting is the
development of smart phones and how they seem stagnant. Cell phones have
developed greatly over the years to where they are now. In the recent years
though, I have found it interesting as to how a lot of companies, like Apple or
Samsung, manage to make the same kind of phone. This is what I mean. For
example, with Apple and Samsung, it has been a race with between these two
titans. From the IPhone 7 and up you can see where the designs kind of start to
become a bit sleeker and from there between the two companies it seems like it
has be the same phone being developed over and over again. Minor differences
you may see are differences in sizes (usually between 5 to 6 inches), the OS and
an extra camera but other than that nothing to major that has changed. As a
matter of fact, it seems with the last few phones the main obsession has been
on the cameras. So much so to where they just come out with a new phone
every year making their main concern about the camera. I have a Samsung Note
10+ but I have it for the functionality purpose of lasting long, with a better
battery. I have a sister that has the same phone but wants the Samsung Galaxy

Note 20+ Ultra 5G mainly for the camera when both phone essentially work and
operate the same. I suppose dealing with a lot of tech can make you aware of
what makes a good phone and you start to notice a pattern when some
companies manufacture the same phone each year with only one or two added
feature but priced at about $1400. At a certain point, I’m hoping to see a
smartphone with hologram features, ha ha.
