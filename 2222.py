Thanks to the recent technology and the internet, we can file our taxes fairly more easily and faster, and more error free. 
Through the shift from paper-based filing to the electronic-based filing, the recent technology advancement enables us to keep a track of our filing status as well, which comes in super handy. 

Taxes initiated around four thousand five hundred years ago aropund the Mesopotamia era, 
when people used to file taxes in the way of through livestock since it was 
a common and preferd way of currency back then. Then the 
Sixteenth-Amendment was ratified and the control was held by the Congress,
which initiated today's our personal income system. Then the first form of tax titled as 1040 was
created through the Bureau of Interal Revenue. At this time, it was still a pilot stage to see
how people could file taxes without too much trouble. By the 80s, the IRG started to implement the system in the technology to 
utilize computers for processing return. Then comes the 1986, 
the first usage of the electronic-based filing was initiated. 

The electronic-based filing was invented through some groups from Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona. 
The machine called Mitron was first used to initiate electronic production (Davis 2021).
The machine had a reader that comes with modem and this was used to read the tape that contains tax information. 
And this process was performed in prior to getting sent to the IRS. Then the IRS received this tape and got processed by the machine, Zilog. 
This was a old way of supercomputer at that time and was quite revolutionary (Davis 2021).  
Then the new type of machine was introduced, called IBM-Series-One, which was used for processing purposes. 
During the 1990-2000s, another method called Telefile strated to be utilized and this wascompletely processed and completed over the phone (Anderson, 2004).
After this period, a lot of online-based filing systems were introduced such as 
Turbo-Tax, Tax-Act, H&R-Block, to name a few. 

As the technology evolution advanced further, the IRS started putting efforts in promoting the electronic-based filing,
and they built a partnership with Free-File Alliance Co. Their program offered free tax filing for everyone who had access to the businesses
that were available on IRS's website (Fiorino, 2004). By this time, we knew that tax filing software made the whole processmuch easier and the IRS could
expect a lot more of filing volume, therefore the bigger revenue. Also, lucky for us, 
utilizing the tax filing software showed the evidence that those who have used the tax program
have seen the decreased number of cases of overpayment of taxes. 

Before this, approximately 17% of the paper-based filing saw the cases of overpayment of taxes
while only less than the 0.5% of the those who filed through electronic system had error issues (Fiorino, 2004). 
Today, the majority of us including the professionals use tax filing software or e-filing, which is fast, accurate and reliable,
however, the history of such technology has gone through so many different stages, repeatedly inventd and 
improved by many technitians, and we are benefitting from such a long path. 

I've chosen the history of the technology along with taxes since I believe it has significantly 
improved our lives and times and we should all know that by understanding the history, and
the origin of taxes. Taxes have been with us for the longest time, and sadly, will not be gone from this world anytime so soon. 
But even still, the technology advancement has made the whole process easier, and reduce our overpayment of taxes,
and this is a great example of how technology made huge differences for all of us.

TECHNOLOGY AND EVENT INTRODUCTION 2
Technology and Event of E-Filing
Over the years, technology has improved how tax preparers and people themselves can
do their taxes more quickly and more error-free. From paper filing to electronic filing and up-todate technology that keeps all tax laws up to date for better tax reporting. This is the history of
the start of electronic production and its process of improving how taxes are performed.
Tax History
Taxes began 4500 years ago in the early civilization in Mesopotamia where people use to
pay taxes in the form of livestock. That was the preferred currency at the time. In 1913, the
Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, giving Congress the power to apply
personal income tax. In 1914, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued the first income tax form
called the 1040. This first year was a test for people to fill out the form and send it to the Bureau
for verification without paying taxes. In 1916, the Income Tax Act started to adjust tax rates and
income scales (IRS, 2022). At the beginning of 1980 was when the IRS began to see the
implementation of new technology and began to use computers to process returns. The
introduction of electronic filing was first introduced in 1986 (Davis, 2022).
E-filing and Technology
The history of electronic filing started in 1986, when five tax preparers from the
Cincinnati, Raleigh-Durham and Phoenix metropolitan areas were offered to test the program.
The electronic production process consists of using a machine known as Mitron (Davis, 2022).
The machine worked when the tax preparer put a tape with tax information into the machine
because the machine was a tape reader with a modem. This was done before transferring to the
IRS. Once the tape was delivered to the IRS, it entered a machine called Zilog. This is a Zilog
S8000 which was a small supercomputer that read the data on the tape and organized it in a
manner that could be read by the IRSâ€™s Unisys system (Davis, 2022). In 1988, IRS stopped
operating the Zilog S8000 and started IBM Series 1 processing systems. During the 1990s and
2000s, Telefile was used to file the 1040-ez form, which was completed by phone (Anderson,
2005). In addition to all these ways of filing tax returns online, several different software
programs have been put in place for tax preparers and individuals. Examples of software to use:
Turbo Tax, Tax Act, H&R Block and Taxwise.

TECHNOLOGY AND EVENT INTRODUCTION 3
As part of the IRS's efforts to promote e-filing systems, the IRS has partnered with a host
of companies we have collectively referred to as the Free File alliance LLC. This offered free tax
preparation for those accessing any of the businesses available on the IRS website (Fiorino,
2005). We know that the use of tax software improves the experience of taxpayers and
accelerates the processing of clients' taxes by tax preparers. Over the years, there has been
evidence that people who use tax programs have eliminated the overpayment of taxes.
Approximately 17.5% of paper income tax returns were the subject of an error that resulted in an
overpayment of tax and only .5% of the electronic repositories had errors (Fiorino,2005). This
process is faster with faster delivery of all refunds due to taxpayers. Not only has there been free
filing offers to people, but there can be a small fee for filing the state filings. In the long run, it is
worth it to a lot of people because of the savings it has made in reducing taxes. The only problem
with e-filing is that it removes the social interaction that people would have with a tax preparer.
As many people may use email and digitization technology to send the necessary data to a tax
preparer to file tax returns for their clients. Even if just an individual does the taxes themselves
there is no interaction unless they run into an issue, they can use the expert help through the
software programs that is available to them.
General education interdisciplinary lens
I chose to write about the history of taxes and technology because I feel it is important
that people understand the history of the origin of taxes. Taxes have existed for a long time and
will not disappear any time soon. With the enhancement of technology every day, it helps make
life easier, even when it comes to filing taxes. Technology takes many different forms and has
made a difference for many businesses and individuals.
