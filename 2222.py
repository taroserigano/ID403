TECHNOLOGY AND EVENT INTRODUCTION 2
Technology and Event of E-Filing
Over the years, technology has improved how tax preparers and people themselves can
do their taxes more quickly and more error-free. From paper filing to electronic filing and up-todate technology that keeps all tax laws up to date for better tax reporting. This is the history of
the start of electronic production and its process of improving how taxes are performed.
Tax History
Taxes began 4500 years ago in the early civilization in Mesopotamia where people use to
pay taxes in the form of livestock. That was the preferred currency at the time. In 1913, the
Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, giving Congress the power to apply
personal income tax. In 1914, the Bureau of Internal Revenue issued the first income tax form
called the 1040. This first year was a test for people to fill out the form and send it to the Bureau
for verification without paying taxes. In 1916, the Income Tax Act started to adjust tax rates and
income scales (IRS, 2022). At the beginning of 1980 was when the IRS began to see the
implementation of new technology and began to use computers to process returns. The
introduction of electronic filing was first introduced in 1986 (Davis, 2022).
E-filing and Technology
The history of electronic filing started in 1986, when five tax preparers from the
Cincinnati, Raleigh-Durham and Phoenix metropolitan areas were offered to test the program.
The electronic production process consists of using a machine known as Mitron (Davis, 2022).
The machine worked when the tax preparer put a tape with tax information into the machine
because the machine was a tape reader with a modem. This was done before transferring to the
IRS. Once the tape was delivered to the IRS, it entered a machine called Zilog. This is a Zilog
S8000 which was a small supercomputer that read the data on the tape and organized it in a
manner that could be read by the IRSâ€™s Unisys system (Davis, 2022). In 1988, IRS stopped
operating the Zilog S8000 and started IBM Series 1 processing systems. During the 1990s and
2000s, Telefile was used to file the 1040-ez form, which was completed by phone (Anderson,
2005). In addition to all these ways of filing tax returns online, several different software
programs have been put in place for tax preparers and individuals. Examples of software to use:
Turbo Tax, Tax Act, H&R Block and Taxwise.

TECHNOLOGY AND EVENT INTRODUCTION 3
As part of the IRS's efforts to promote e-filing systems, the IRS has partnered with a host
of companies we have collectively referred to as the Free File alliance LLC. This offered free tax
preparation for those accessing any of the businesses available on the IRS website (Fiorino,
2005). We know that the use of tax software improves the experience of taxpayers and
accelerates the processing of clients' taxes by tax preparers. Over the years, there has been
evidence that people who use tax programs have eliminated the overpayment of taxes.
Approximately 17.5% of paper income tax returns were the subject of an error that resulted in an
overpayment of tax and only .5% of the electronic repositories had errors (Fiorino,2005). This
process is faster with faster delivery of all refunds due to taxpayers. Not only has there been free
filing offers to people, but there can be a small fee for filing the state filings. In the long run, it is
worth it to a lot of people because of the savings it has made in reducing taxes. The only problem
with e-filing is that it removes the social interaction that people would have with a tax preparer.
As many people may use email and digitization technology to send the necessary data to a tax
preparer to file tax returns for their clients. Even if just an individual does the taxes themselves
there is no interaction unless they run into an issue, they can use the expert help through the
software programs that is available to them.
General education interdisciplinary lens
I chose to write about the history of taxes and technology because I feel it is important
that people understand the history of the origin of taxes. Taxes have existed for a long time and
will not disappear any time soon. With the enhancement of technology every day, it helps make
life easier, even when it comes to filing taxes. Technology takes many different forms and has
made a difference for many businesses and individuals.
